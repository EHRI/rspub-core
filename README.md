## Introduction
The [ResourceSync specification](http://www.openarchives.org/rs/1.0.9/resourcesync) describes 
a synchronization framework for the web consisting of various capabilities that allow third-party systems to remain synchronized with a server's evolving resources.
More precisely the ResourceSync Framework describes the communication between `source` and `destination` aimed at
synchronizing one or more resources. Communication uses `http` and an extension on 
the [Sitemap protocol](http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html), an xml-based format for expressing metadata, relevant for synchronization.

The software in the `rspub-core` library handles the `source`-side implementation of the framework.
Given a bunch of resources it analyzes these resources and the differences over time and creates
the necessary sitemap-documents that describe the resources and the changes. 

## Overview

_Fig. 1. Overview of the main features of rspub-core._

In essence rspub-core is a one-class, one-method library: class _ResourceSync_, method _execute_.
But there is more:

- RsParameters control the conditions under which the execution takes place. Parameters can
be saved as configuration and restored from disk.
- The selection of resources is done by a ResourceGate that works with one-argument
predicates. How exactly the ResourceGate is
