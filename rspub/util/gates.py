"""
Logical functions. Each logical function takes a one-argument predicate or a list of one-argument predicates.
Each logical function returns a one_argument predicate that is the chain of, or the negation of its arguments.
There are functions to chain predicates along NOT, AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR and XNOR.

The function 'gate' takes two lists of predicates, includes and excludes. Includes is the list of predicates that can
permit x through the gate; excludes is the list of predicates that can prevent x from passing the gate.

Each logical function, before returning the chained predicate, will check if the predicates in the argument list
are truly one-argument predicates. The behavior after detection of a wrong argument can be influenced by setting
    set_stop_on_creation_error(boolean)

The default behavior after detection of a wrong argument is to throw a GateCreationException.
